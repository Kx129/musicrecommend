[02:13.61]Knowing that I was going to get better
[02:15.96]And looking forward to a time that I would feel good again
[02:18.90]Helped me to keep moving forward
[02:21.30]And sometimes I had to be brave
[02:23.95]And it wasn't always easy
[02:25.90]Sometimes I faltered
[02:27.57]I had bad days
[02:29.3]But I realized that being brave isn't supposed to be easy
[02:32.77]As for me
[02:34.1]I feel it's the key way to keep moving forward
